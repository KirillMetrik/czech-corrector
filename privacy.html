Privacy Policy - Czech Corrector (AI)

Last updated: 15 October 2025

1. Overview
Czech Corrector (AI) is a Chrome Extension that helps users improve the quality of their Czech language text. When you
select text and choose “Correct Czech (AI)”, the extension sends only that selected text to the OpenAI API to generate a
corrected version, which is then shown directly on your device.

2. Information We Process
• Selected text you explicitly send for correction.
• No other data (such as page URLs or metadata) is collected or stored.
• Your OpenAI API key is stored locally in Chrome via chrome.storage.sync and never shared with any server controlled by
the developer.

3. How Data Is Used
The selected text is transmitted securely to api.openai.com using HTTPS, processed by OpenAI’s models to produce the
corrected text, then immediately discarded.
No copy is kept by this extension.

4. Third-Party Services
• OpenAI API (processes text for correction)
Please see OpenAI's own Privacy Policy: https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy

5. Data Retention & Access
We do not store or retain any user content or usage data.

6. Permissions Justification

• activeTab + scripting - to replace selected text on the current page.
• storage - to save API key and settings.
• host_permissions: https://api.openai.com/* - to call the OpenAI API.
